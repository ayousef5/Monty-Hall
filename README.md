# üé≤ Monty Hall Simulator

This project simulates the Monty Hall problem in Java.  
The program runs thousands of simulations to compare the chances of **switching** vs **not switching** doors.

## üìå How It Works
- A prize is hidden behind one of three doors.  
- The player picks a door.  
- One of the other empty doors is revealed.  
- The player can choose to **stay** or **switch**.  
- The program repeats this process many times to calculate winning percentages.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Program
1. Compile and run `MontyHall.java`.  
2. The simulator automatically runs 10,000 games for switching and not switching.  
3. It prints the winning percentages for both strategies.
